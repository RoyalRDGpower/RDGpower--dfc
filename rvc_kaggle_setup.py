# RVC Voice Cloning Setup for Kaggle (via GitHub)
# Author: Supreme Giant AI for King Clark

# STEP 1: Install all dependencies
!pip install -q gradio librosa numpy soundfile torch torchaudio

# STEP 2: Clone the RVC inference repository
!git clone https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion.git rvc
%cd rvc

# STEP 3: Upload or reference your voice model files
# Kaggle supports file uploads or loading from GitHub/GDrive/URLs
# Replace with actual links if needed, or upload in the right sidebar

# Example local file paths
model_path = "model.pth"           # Upload your trained model file
config_path = "config.json"         # Upload your config file
input_audio = "input.wav"           # Your voice sample to be cloned

# STEP 4: (Optional) Pull sample model + audio from GitHub for testing
# !wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/sample-model/model.pth -O model.pth
# !wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/sample-model/config.json -O config.json
# !wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/sample-audio/input.wav -O input.wav

# STEP 5: (Placeholder) Inference Code - customize this based on the actual script used by RVC
# For example, use inference_main.py or infer_tool.py from the cloned repo

# Example pseudocode:
# from infer_tool import RVCInferencer
# inferencer = RVCInferencer(model_path, config_path)
# output_audio = inferencer.convert(input_audio)

print("âœ… Setup completed. Run your specific inference code now.")
